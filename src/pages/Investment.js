            <p>
              You will get 50-100 images per hour. For example, if you booked an
              eight hour day you can expect anywhere 400-800. I will let you in
              on a little secret I tend to over-deliver. ;)

            <p>
              I am flattered and overjoyed you want me to capture this special
              time in your life. First things first, let's learn more about each
              other by grabbing coffee or hopping on a call. From there, I will
              walk you through the entire wedding experience, dots some i's and
              crosses the t's, and then you could say we are Facebook official.

            <h2>Is This Worth It? Uncle Joe Bob Just Got A New Camera.</h2>
            <p>
              Yes, 100% yes it's worth it. Here's why, these are pictures you
              will have forever. If I had a penny for every bridesmaid that told
              me she wished she would have spent more on a photographer - I'd
              have several dollars. ;) I want your wedding day to be an
              incredible experience from start to finish. I will be your dress
              holding, bobby-pin giving, find the coordinator, locate great
              grandma, tell you that you look gorgeous, all-the-things
              photographer on your day.
